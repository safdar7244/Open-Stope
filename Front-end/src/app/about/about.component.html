    <h2 id="Stability_Graph">The Stability Graph</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The stability graph method was introduced four decades ago by Mathews et al. <a href="/about#ref-1">[1]</a> and 
became popular after modification by Potvin <a href="/about#ref-2">[2]</a>. It is used to estimate the stability 
state of the open stopes in underground mines, which are large non-entry voids designated 
to mass extraction of ores. The critical review on the stability graph, its evolution and limitations 
can be found in <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a>.
    </p>
  
    <h2 id="Original_Stability_Graph">The Original Stability Graph</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>With the technological development and potential of large blast holes, open stoping has become economically 
attractive. However, even if some dilution caused by rock failure from walls or roof is tolerable, increased 
stope sizes increase the instability of the open stopes and lead to potential excessive dilution, 
consequently, resulting in high cost. Mathews et al. (1981) <a href="/about#ref-1">[1]</a> conducted an empirical study to determine if
there is a relationship between rockmass characteristics, mining depth and stability of open stopes. As a 
result of this research work, the stability graph was developed based on 26 data from three mines to predict
the stability state of stopes. The axes of the stability graph are defined according to equations (1) and (3). 
The graph is a plot of a stability number, N, against a shape factor (S), also referred to as hydraulic radius, 
HR. It is demonstrated in Figure 1.

  <h2 id="Modified_Stability_Graph">The Modified Stability Graph</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Although the stability graph concepts were well established by Mathews’ et al. (1981), further refinement 
of the method was necessary because of insufficient data to confirm the reliability of the graph to use as 
a stope stability prediction tool. Seven years later, Potvin <a href="/about#ref-2">[2]</a> modified the stability graph by increasing 
the initial data to 175 case histories from 34 mines and re-calibrating the adjustment factors. The modified 
stability graph is given in Figure 3.

  </div>
  
  <p>Stewart and Forsyth (1995) <a href="/about#ref-6">[6]</a> criticized Potvin for using the word “cave” for an essentially unstable 
zone. Moreover, after a review of both Mathew’s and Potvin’s stability graphs, authors <a href="/about#ref-6">[6]</a> argued that 
the former’s hypothesis was reasonably good proven by additional data, while the latter’s modification 
to the adjustment factors may lead to overconfidence in stope prediction. However, as Suorineni (2010) 
<a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a> notes the reliability of the empirical method increases with data size and quality, so added data by 
Potvin to the initial stability graph makes it more reliable. Currently, the modified stability 
graph by Potvin is the preferred stope stability prediction method used by practitioners and mine engineers in 
Canada.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="Extended_Stability_Graph">The Extended Stability Graph</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Trueman and his colleagues extended the stability graph database from 175 cases to 483 case histories <a href="/about#ref-7">[7]</a>. 
It should be noted, however, that the added data came from both entry and non-entry mining methods. With 
additional data, the range of the stability graph components has become broader. Modified Q value is between
0.01 and 90, shape factor ranges from 1 m to 55 m, the calculated stability number varies between 0.005 and
700 [<a href="/about#ref-7">7</a>, <a href="/about#ref-8">8</a>, <a href="/about#ref-9">9</a>]. The authors used logistic regression with a log-log form to produce the extended stability 
graph. As it is seen in Figure 4, the transition zone is clearer in the log-log form. Using regression 
analysis, the stability state of the open stope surfaces was defined probabilistically in the transition 
zones. Despite these advantages of the extended stability graph, it is limited by the stability number 
being estimated using the original adjustment factors proposed by Matthews et al. (1981) <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a>. It is also 
problematic because the authors combined entry and non-entry stope mining methods. The authors of the 
extended stability graph gave a preference to the original adjustment factors stating that there is no 
difference in predicting open stope stability state estimated using the original and modified stability 
number factors. A mixed database from entry and non-entry mining methods and using original adjustment 
factors in the extended stability graph pose a challenge to compare and combine the extended and modified 
stability graphs. Inclusion of the continuous caving data to the extended stability graph development is also misleading since the 
factors considered critical for open stope stability by the original developers of the method are not same 
for continuous caving in caving mining methods.

both methods are integrated into the web-based open stope design tool to give a choice to users.

  <h2 id="Refined_Stability_Graph">The Refined Stability Graph</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>The extended stability graph is inconsistent due to mixed database, which comes from both open stoping and 
entry-type mining methods <a href="/about#ref-7">[7]</a>. Additionally, use of the original factors in calculation of the stability number 
puts barrier to compare and combine the modified and extended stability graphs <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a>. To eliminate these 
drawbacks of the extended stability graph, the extended stability graph was refined on the basis of revised
database, modified factors and applying logistic regression. The refined stability graph is shown in Figure 5.
It is a recommended version of the stability graph that should be referred to when estimating the stability
of open stopes. More information on the refined stability graph can be found in <a href="/about#ref-10">[10]</a>.

  <h2 id="Shape_Factor">Shape Factor</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Shape factor is incorporated into the stability graph to account for stope geometry. It is also termed
as a hydraulic radius and calculated using Eq. (3). The hydraulic radius is not always suitable for 
rectangular stope walls. Two stope hangingwalls (HWs) with different sizes can result in equal hydraulic
radius. For example, HW with 18 m height and 30 m strike length and another HW with 25 m height and 20.5 m 
strike have an equal HR of 5.63 m. The different horizontal and vertical elongation of stope surface has 
a different impact on dilution due to induced stresses. The dilution from a taller (vertical) rectangular 
stope surface is greater than from a shorter (horizontal) rectangular wall because of unfavorable induced 
stress conditions. Suorineni (2010) <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a> suggests aspect ratio application to distinguish between stope 
walls with equal HR and different surface dimensions. The aspect ratio is a ratio of stope surface strike 
length and the true height of the stope. In the above example, two stope walls have aspect ratios of 1.67 
and 0.82, respectively.  
One more disadvantage of shape factor is that it cannot account for the irregular shape and complex 
geometries of the stopes. As an alternative, Milne et al. (2004) <a href="/about#ref-11">[11]</a> proposed the effective radius factor
(ERF) in Eq. (4), which is modified from hydraulic radius.

<h2 id="Adjustment_Factors">Adjustment Factors</h2>
<hr>
<p>Factors A, B and C were incorporated into the stability number calculation to account for the effect of 
stress, joint orientation and gravity, respectively. With the increased data by Potvin, the initial graphs 
for these factors were modified, subsequently led to the modified stability number N’. Experience with the 
application of these factors indicates that stress and gravity factors still need to be reconsidered and
re-defined. The different case histories on mine site reveal that faults/shear zones near open 
stopes, stand-up time of the stopes and blasting also affect the stope stability and need to be accounted 
for. 
</p>

<p> To date, one group of thought prefers to use the original adjustment factors to calculate the stability 
number [<a href="/about#ref-6">6</a>, <a href="/about#ref-7">7</a>, <a href="/about#ref-9">9</a>], 
while another group favors the modified stability number factors [<a href="/about#ref-2">2</a>, <a href="/about#ref-3">3</a>]. However, it is 
known that the original adjustment factors were developed based on 26 case histories from one mine, 
whereas Potvin used 175 case data from three mines to modify the adjustment factors. Considering that the 
empirical method reliability increases with the size and quality of the data, it is reasonable to give a 
preference to use of modified adjustment factors.
</p>
     
<h2 id="Factor_A">Stress Factor (A)</h2>
<hr>
<p>Factor A reflects the effect of induced stress and ranges from 0.1 to 1 for highly loaded and destressed
rockmass according to Potvin’s modifications (see Figure 8a). Suorineni (2010) <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a> states that the stress
factor is flawed in that it does not include tension, which also causes rock failure. Additionally,
stress factor has a controversial meaning and should consider the effects of gravity factor as 
discussed in <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a>. Diederichs and Kaiser (1999) <a href="/about#ref-14">[14]</a> 
proposed a new stress factor graph shown in Figure 8b to account for tensile stress. However, this chart needs to be verified because there
is still no consideration of “partial relaxation and moderate stresses in blocky rock mass” <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a>. 
Later, Mitri, Hughes, and Zhang (2011) <a href="/about#ref-15">[15]</a> also developed a new graph for determination of a new
stress factor to incorporate tension. It was based on asymptotic function and is illustrated in 
Figure 8c. It is seen from the chart that the maximum value of the new factor A is reached when 
the maximum stress to compressive strength ratio is 0.3. The authors explained this peak value by
a brittle Hoek-Brown damage initiation criterion proposed by Martin (1997) <a href="/about#ref-16">[16]</a>, which states stress
induced failure initiates at loads approximately one third of the UCS. Moreover, another argument 
was the fairly close location of peak value to the one in the original graph.
</p>
<p>Vallejos et al. (2016) <a href="/about#ref-17">[17]</a> used contingency matrix and performance metrics to analyze the significance 
of adjustment factors in the stability graph. The researchers found that Peirce Skill Score (PSS), which
is a measure of performance model, for factor A proposed by Mitri, Hughes, and Zhang (2011) <a href="/about#ref-15">[15]</a> is low.
Subsequently, Vallejos et al. (2016) <a href="/about#ref-17">[17]</a> proposed a new stress factor with a slight difference from 
the original stress factor graph, but with high influence on stability state boundaries in the stability
graph (see Figure 8d). The authors assure that the modified stress factor increases the admissible 
shape factor, consequently, increasing the stope size. Vallejos, Delonca, and Perez (2018) <a href="/about#ref-18">[18]</a> also
developed the below condition for stress factor considering the effect of three-dimensional stress 
using numerical modeling. However, they did not account for tension.

<p>Various works were accomplished on development of a new stress factor graph. However, none of them

<hr>
<p>It is often when the vertical and horizontal stresses are unknown in the prefeasibility and feasibility
stages of a mining project. In this case, induced stresses can be calculated using Young’s Modulus and 
excavation depth. Particularly, the vertical stress is computed from Eq. (9) taken from <a href="/about#ref-19">[19]</a>. This equation 
represents the empirical relationship between the vertical stress and excavation depth shown in 
Figure 9.1.

<hr>
<p>It is necessary to find the induced stress to calculate the stress factor A. There are two ways to find

horizontal stresses or excavation depth and Young’s Modulus. The detailed diagram of reaching induced 
stress calculation is given in Figure 10. Using two inputs, both vertical and horizontal components of
the stress can be computed. Then, these stresses along with k value (ratio of horizontal stress and 
vertical stress) and height to span ratio are used to calculate the induced stress.

11 for hangingwall and footwall and Figure 12 for stope back and sidewalls <a href="/about#ref-1">[1]</a>. The induced stress needs
to be calculated at the center of the stope surface. In-situ stresses are computed from the height to 
span ratio and ratio of horizontal and vertical stresses (k value). It should be noted that the negative
value in below graph implies tension on the hangingwall and footwall, and subsequently, cause stress 
factor to be 1 for this case.

<h2 id="Factor_B">Joint Defect Factor (B)</h2>
<hr>
<p>Factor B in the stability number estimation is included to account for the presence of critical 
structures as joints, bedding planes and foliation <a href="/about#ref-21">[21]</a>. The joint defect factor is defined by the 
orientation of critical joints relative to stope surface from Figure 13a. Melo, Pinto, and Dutra (2014) 
<a href="/about#ref-22">[22]</a> applied modified factor B to Brazilian Mines and found that it is poorly applicable to footwalls. 
Bewick and Kaiser (2009) <a href="/about#ref-23">[23]</a> applied numerical modeling to assess the Factor B and obtained the graph shown in Figure 13b. B factor curves derived from numerical and empirical methods have a considerable 
difference between angles 0 and 40. Suorineni (2010) <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a> states this is due to pre-model setting in 
numerical analysis, for example, joint spacing of 2 m is unusual for common stopes. From Figure 13b, 
the difference between original and modified B factors can also be observed. This is important to note 
because Trueman and Mawdesley (2003) <a href="/about#ref-7">[7]</a> refined the stability graph based on original adjustment factors 
considering there is no significant difference between original and modified factors.

<h2 id="Factor_C">Gravity Factor (C)</h2>
<hr>
<p>Gravity factor (C) is related to the mode of failure as gravity fall, slabbing and sliding. 
Its shortcoming is that it is not applicable to stope footwalls <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a>. 
Although it is considered to be applicable to hangingwalls with dips between 0-90⁰, the database used to develop the C factor 
chart contains only hangingwall information with dips between 60⁰-80⁰ <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a>. It was found that the 
original gravity factor chart does not work for footwalls with dips less than 70⁰ as well as for 
sliding failure cases [<a href="/about#ref-2">2</a>, <a href="/about#ref-25">24</a>, <a href="/about#ref-25">25</a>]. 
The functional gravity factor chart for sliding failure of the 
footwall was constructed by <a href="/about#ref-24">[24]</a> and accepted by current practitioners. The further research is 
required to unite the stress factor and gravity factor <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a>. The gravity factor is currently assessed 
using Figure 15a.

<h2 id="Factor_T">Time Factor (T)</h2>
<hr>
<p>After sequencing of stopes or blasting operations, stress is redistributed and come to equilibrium
state after some time. It was observed that the stand-up time of the stope highly influences on 
rock mass behavior, thereby, stope stability [<a href="/about#ref-11">11</a>, 
<a href="/about#ref-26">26</a>, <a href="/about#ref-27">27</a>]. Suorineni (2010) <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a> noted from Dun 
and Pakalnis (1996) that dilution and open stope sloughage increase with the stand-up time of 
open stope. Tannant and Diederichs (1997) <a href="/about#ref-28">[28]</a> proposed the time correlation factor to incorporate 
into the stability number calculation after observation of the stope wall condition at Kidd Mine. 
Time correlation factor according to Q’ value can be obtained from Table 5. The stability number 
equation becomes as following with time effect incorporation:

<p>In this web tool, time factor is calculated based on Table 5. </p>
<p>Suorineni (1998) <a href="/about#ref-29">[12]</a> recommended to include time effect in gravity factor C through a suitable
excavation support ratio (ESR) <a href="/about#ref-4">[4]</a> from Table 6, which accounts for time and should be used in 
calculation of the original gravity factor. The original gravity factor is conservative because it was 
developed based on ESR of 1.6 for permanent openings <a href="/about#ref-1">[1]</a>, while open stope is temporary opening. 
Therefore, gravity factor that properly accounts for time effect can be estimated from Eq. (15) 
with corresponding Figure 16.

<h2 id="Factor_F">Fault Factor (F)</h2>
<hr>
<p>Suorineni (2010) <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a> notes that the original, modified and extended stability graphs lack the fault
consideration, which affects open stope stability. At many mine sites, stope walls evaluated as stable
employing the stability graph often fail due to the presence of faults. This failure leads to ore 
dilution, ore loss and unexpected increased cost if the fault presence is ignored or not considered.
To correct this flaw of the stability graph, Suorineni, Tannant, and Kaiser (1999) <a href="/about#ref-31">[31]</a> developed the
fault factor (F) to integrate it into the stability number estimation for open stope stability assessment.
The chart of fault factor for the specific fault case is shown in Figure 17. It should be noted that 
when the fault is inclined at approximately 20-30⁰ to the stope surface, it impacts the stope stability 
greatly, while perpendicular faults to the surface have a negligible influence on the stope. In case of 
presence of close faults, the stability number should be calculated using the following equation:

<h2 id="SG_Database">Stability Graph Database</h2>
<hr>
<p>This section presents the refined stability graph (RSG) database, which is a refined version of the 
extended stability graph database and used for reproducing the refined stability graph (Figure 5). 
The refined stability graph database can be downloaded <a href="/download" download="Stope-Database.clsx">here</a>. The basic parameters forming the refined
stability graph include the modified stability number, shape factor, modified Q (Q′), modified stability
number adjustment factors and the types of stope surfaces (i.e. backs, hangingwalls, footwalls and endwalls).
The ranges of the quantitative parameters are shown in Table 7 and the frequency of occurrence of the 
quantitative and qualitative factors are shown in Figure 18. 
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <p>Table 7. Summary of the ranges of parameters based on the Original and Modified Stability Graph 
number factors in the refined Extended Stability Graph database <a href="/about#ref-10">[10]</a>.</p>
  <img src="assets/img/Table 7.jpg" alt="Statistical Analysis of the refined database" style="width:50%;">
</div>

<p>The frequency of occurrence of the values of the quantitative parameters are based on 88 stope backs,
66 stope endwalls and 162 stope footwalls and hangingwalls in the RSG database <a href="/about#ref-10">[10]</a>. The frequencies
of occurrence of these data in Figure 18 allow the determination of whether the data is biased towards
one stope surface or value, for example. The characteristics observed in Figure 18 (a–f), are summarised
as follows <a href="/about#ref-10">[10]</a>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<p>Figure 18(a) shows that the hydraulic radii of ∼50% of the stope surfaces in the refined database
varies between 5 and 9 m. Only 2.2% of all stope surfaces have hydraulic radii greater than 17 m.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>Figure 18(b) shows that 76% of the values of stress factor (A) for all hangingwalls and footwalls 
in the refined database falls within the range of 0.9–1.0, indicating relaxed zones. This implies 
that the stopes are designed to have the hangingwall perpendicular to the major principal stress 
which is horizontal in Canada and Australia (the two major sources of the database). This may 
imply that in stress environments where the major principal stress is vertical rather than 
horizontal, the stability graph method should be used with caution. This observation also shows 
that the lack of difference between transition zones in Figure 10 may be the result of bias in 
the database towards relaxed stope surfaces.
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>Figure 18(c) shows that for 84% of all footwalls and hangingwalls, the distribution of the
joint orientation factor (B) in the RSG database is between 0.2 and 0.4. Based on this range, 
the dip difference between the critical joint and stope surface varies from 0° to 40°. More than 
50% of the stope backs have similar Factor B distribution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>Figure 18(d) for the gravity factor (C) distribution shows that 58.6% of footwalls and hangingwalls
have dips between 80° and 90°, whereas 95% of backs dip at 0–30°. This suggests that more than half
of the case histories in the refined database come from steeply dipping orebodies, a characteristic
to open stope mining method.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>The distribution of Factor C for hangingwalls is shown in Figure 18(e). The dip of more than 
90% of the hangingwalls is between 60° and 90°.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>Figure 18(f) shows the distribution of types of stope surfaces in the database. Based on the
figure, 28% of the data are from stope backs, 52% are from hangingwalls and footwalls, and 20% 
are from stope endwalls.</p>

<h2 id="ELOS">ELOS Graph for Dilution Estimations</h2>
<hr>
<p>The stability graph is intended to predict the stability state of open stopes qualitatively, 
while the major concern of the industry is an amount of over-break that causes ore dilution 
leading to excessive cost. Dilution lines first were added to the stability graph by <a href="/about#ref-32">[32]</a>. 
Clark and Pakalnis (1997) <a href="/about#ref-25">[25]</a> introduced ELOS (Equivalent Linear Overbreak/Sloughing) term 
to quantitatively estimate the ore dilution from hangingwall and footwall instability 
(see Figure 19). Eq. (17.1) and (17.2) assists in estimation of the relative dilution. 
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<p>Since ELOS graph was developed based on limited data, Capes (2009) <a href="/about#ref-33">[33]</a> extended the 
database adding 229 ELOS cases and revised the design lines for HW dilution chart using 
statistical tools. One more variation is the dilution graph developed by Papaioanou and 
Suorineni (2016) <a href="/about#ref-34">[34]</a> to eliminate the limitation of the initial ELOS graph, which was 
applicable only to narrow-vein orebodies <a href="/about#ref-35">[35]</a>. Papaioanou and Suorineni (2016) <a href="/about#ref-34">[34]</a> 
applied the logistic regression and Bayesian likelihood discrimination method on 226 
case data from 6 underground mines in Australia to elaborate a quantitative stability 
graph for dilution prediction. Figure 20 presents the generalized dilution-based 
stability graph that is independent of orebody width.

<h2 id="SG_Cablebolt_Design">The Stability Graph for Cablebolt Design</h2>
<hr>
<p>Open stopes are susceptible to hangingwall sloughage. To stabilize the footwalls and hangingwalls,
cablebolts are appropriate support types due to the flexible size that can be cut to the desired length.
To assist mine engineers with underground support design, the first cablebolt design graph was built
by Diederichs and Hutchinson (1999) <a href="/about#ref-36">[36]</a>. It has features as cablebolt spacing, type and length 
selection and can be found in work of [36]. Suorineni (2010) <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a> notes that for standard stope size,
the chart tends to give the cablebolting pattern of 2.2 m because it was developed based on 
Potvin-Nickson stability graph. 
</p>

<h2 id="Risk_based_SG">The Risk-based Stability Graph</h2>
<hr>
<p>The risk-based stability graphs are of interest because they can account for uncertainties.
The main advantage of these graphs is that they enable sizing of stopes according to risk of 
dilution amount, which is acceptable based on mining companies’ decision <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a>. The risk-based 
graphs were developed applying statistics by [<a href="/about#ref-9">9</a>, <a href="/about#ref-37">37</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Figure 21 illustrates one of the risk-based stability graphs developed using likelihood statistics
[<a href="/about#ref-29">29</a>, <a href="/about#ref-37">37</a>]. Likelihood ratio, Ʌ, and multiple contours describes different levels of risk in stope 
performance. </p>

<h2 id="SG_Transition_Zones">Transition Zones on the Stability Graph</h2>
<hr>
<p>The stability state of open stope is evaluated according to three zones as stable, unstable and 
cave in the conventional stability graph (see Figure 1). Both Mathews et al. (1981) <a href="/about#ref-1">[1]</a> and Potvin 
(1988) <a href="/about#ref-2">[2]</a> had drawn transition lines through “eyeballing” based on a cluster of scattered data. 
Moreover, initial developers of the method divided the graph into three zones, while Potvin only 
differentiated stable and failed cases with a single zone. Nickson (1992) <a href="/about#ref-5">[5]</a> first delineated 
the transition lines statistically in Potvin’s modified stability graph dividing it into three 
zones as in the original stability graph and eliminating the initial subjectivity of transition zones.
</p>

<p>Stewart and Forsyth (1995) <a href="/about#ref-6">[6]</a> criticized Potvin’s single boundary zone because of its definitive 
nature indicating stope state only as stable and cave and missing unstable state of stopes, which 
may be stabilized with the support systems. Stewart and Forsyth (1995) <a href="/about#ref-6">[6]</a> proposed to extend the 
stability graph zones to four states as potentially stable, potentially unstable, potential major 
failure and potential caving separated by three boundaries. According to Suorineni (2010) <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a>, 
using the word “potential” is more rational than a definitive description of stope stability state, 
because the stability graph tends to predict the stability level of stopes and provide probable stope 
behavior rather than stating stope stability or failure definitively. 
</p>

<p>While updating the stability graph with extended data, Trueman with his colleagues recognized 
that the transition zones change as the amount of data increases [<a href="/about#ref-7">7</a>, <a href="/about#ref-9">9</a>]. In Figure 22, the dashed 
lines indicate the transition boundaries between stable-failure and failure-major failure with 400 
cases, while continuous lines were drawn based on 483 datasets introducing the caving zone and 
combining failure-major failure. Suorineni (2010) <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a> recommends using the latest updated stability 
graph by Trueman et al. (2003) <a href="/about#ref-7">[7]</a> because of its reliability associated with data size and quality 
as well as logistic regression applied to delineate the boundary lines. However, he also suggests 
inclusion of the failure-major failure boundary line to the updated stability graph to minimize 
the uncertainty between stable and caving zones. 
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/img/Figure 22.png" alt="The effect of data increase on transition zone" style="width:40%;">
  <p>Figure 22. The effect of data increase on transition zone <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>It can be concluded from various stability graph transition zones that 1) with the increasing 
data, the reliability of the stability graph prediction increases; 2) transition lines are not 
static, these boundary lines between stability state zones change with the increased data. 
Considering these two points, it is planned to design the web-based stability graph so that 
it will allow an addition of data by users and adjustment of boundary lines accordingly through 
employing statistical tools and machine learning techniques. 
</p>

<h2 id="SG_Statistical_Analysis">Statistical Analysis of the Stability Graph</h2>
<hr>
<p>Mark (2016) <a href="/about#ref-38">[38]</a> lists statistical analysis as one of the compulsory steps in empirical design 
in mining. In the past, statistical analysis was proven to be a superior technique to refine 
empirical approaches and to enhance design reliability. It is a useful tool that assists engineering 
judgement to interpret the large database and establish the relationship between dependent and 
independent variables. The first application of statistics to the stability graph was accomplished 
by Nickson (1992) <a href="/about#ref-5">[5]</a> and Hadjigeorgiou, Leclaire, and Potvin (1995) <a href="/about#ref-24">[24]</a> independently on Potvin’s 
modified stability graph to delineate the stability zones objectively. Furthermore, Clark and Pakalnis
(1997) <a href="/about#ref-25">[25]</a> employed discriminant analysis to validate the design zones in ELOS graph. Suorineni (1998) 
<a href="/about#ref-29">[29]</a> used Bayesian likelihood statistic to re-interpret the stability state of stopes in the stability 
graph. Trueman and Mawdesley (2003) <a href="/about#ref-7">[7]</a> adopted logistic regression to improve the reliability of the 
stability graph through processing data and delineating stability state zones in the stability chart. 
With the help of logit model Stewart and Trueman (2001) <a href="/about#ref-39">[39]</a> revealed that the minimum of 150 cases 
with at least 10 % of unstable case data are necessary to develop a site-specific stability graph. 
A full probabilistic analysis of the stability graph was carried out by Suorineni (1998) <a href="/about#ref-29">[29]</a> through 
Bayesian likelihood statistics. It was concluded that Bayesian likelihood discrimination enables to 
define overlapping degrees between transitional zones, optimize stability state boundaries, calculate 
the performance prediction error and risk cost, and develop multiple design curves in the stability 
graph considering the probability of stope performance. Bayesian likelihood method along with logistic 
regression was also used by Papaioanou and Suorineni (2016) <a href="/about#ref-34">[34]</a> to produce a generalized 
dilution-based stability graph for open stope design, which does not need orebody width to be 
considered. Considering these studies, it can be stated that the empirical method, particularly, 
stability graph is advanced with the application of statistical approach. As mentioned before, Potvin’s modified graph and Trueman and 
Mawdesley’s (2003) <a href="/about#ref-7">[7]</a> extended stability graph will be integrated into the web-based 
stope stability prediction to give a choice to users.

<h2 id="SG_Limitations">The limitations of the Stability Graph</h2>
<hr>
<p>The stability graph development and its limitations are well formulated in Suorineni (2010) <a href="/about#ref-3">[3]</a>. 
Some of the shortcomings of the stability graph related to adjustment factors, fault and time 
effects were discussed above. Other significant limitations of the stability graph are listed below: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The stability graph was developed without considering the stope width, therefore, it cannot 
  properly predict the stope stability when applied to narrow vein mining. This was established by 
  Suorineni (1998) <a href="/about#ref-29">[29]</a> when evaluating the stope performance at AngloGold Ashanti Mines. Later, 
  Stewart, Trueman and Lyman (2007) <a href="/about#ref-40">[40]</a> also realized this drawback of the empirical method in 
  Australian mines. Therefore, stability graph should be used with caution when applied to narrow 
  vein mining. 
  </li>
  <li>Stope surface stability made from backfill cannot be assessed using the stability graph since 
  backfill stability was not accounted for when developing the stability graph. 
  </li>
  <li>The stability graph ignores the blasting effect, which essentially creates fractures and 
  contributes to the instability of the stope. 
  </li>
</ul>
